# Combinations

## Definition

We are often interested in determining how many **different groups of $r$ objects** can be formed from a total of $n$ distinct objects, **when the order of selection does not matter**.

## Derivation

To count the number of such groups:

- If **order mattered**, we would have: $n(n - 1)(n - 2)\cdots(n - r + 1) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}$
- But each group is **counted $r!$ times** (all permutations of $r$ items), so we divide:
    
    $$
    \text{Number of combinations} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
    $$
    

### Notation and Terminology

The number of combinations is denoted as:

$$
^nC_r = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
$$

- Where,
    - $n$ = No. of total items
    - $r$ = No. of items chosen at once
    - $0 \leq r \leq n$

üí°

$^nC_r$ read as ‚Äú**n choose r**‚Äù and represents the number of ways to choose $r$ items from $n$ **without regard to order**.

</aside>

**Special cases:**

- $\binom{n}{n} = \binom{n}{0} = 1$
- $\binom{n}{r} = 0$ if $r > n$ or $r < 0$

### Example: Basic Selection

**How many committees of 3 can be chosen from 20 people?**

$$
^{20}C_3 = \binom{20}{3} = \frac{20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 1140
$$

### Example: Grouped Selection

**How many committees of 2 women and 3 men from 5 women and 7 men?**

$$
\binom{5}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{3} = 10 \cdot 35 = 350
$$

**With constraint:**

If 2 men are feuding and cannot serve together, subtract combinations that include both:

We select 1 men from remaining 5 men (because 2 men have already used the restricted space)  and 2 women from all the women.

$$
\text{Total Ways} - \binom{5}{1} \cdot \binom{5}{2}\Rightarrow 350 - 50 = 300
$$

### Example: No Consecutive Defectives

**Given $n$ antennas, $m$ defective, and $n - m$ functional, how many arrangements with no two defectives adjacent?**

- Place $n - m$ functional antennas: creates $n - m + 1$ ‚Äúslots‚Äù
- Choose $m$ of those slots: $\binom{n - m + 1}{m}$

## Pascal‚Äôs Identity

Pascal's Identity, also known as Pascal's Rule, is¬†**a fundamental combinatorial identity that relates binomial coefficients**.¬†It states that for any positive integers n and k, with k between 1 and n-1, the binomial coefficient (n choose k) is equal to the sum of (n-1 choose k-1) and (n-1 choose k).¬†In simpler terms, each number in Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.¬†

$$
\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n - 1}{r - 1} + \binom{n - 1}{r}
$$

**Interpretation:** Count of size-r groups that **include** a specific item + those that **exclude** it.

Ts a fundamental identity in combinatorics that expresses a recursive relationship between binomial coefficients:

## Binomial Theorem

The binomial theorem is primarily used¬†**to expand expressions of the form $(x + y)‚Åø$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer**.¬†It provides a formula to find the coefficients and terms in the expanded form of such expressions without direct multiplication.¬†Beyond basic algebra, it has applications in various fields like probability, statistics, and even disaster prediction.¬†

$$
(x + y)^n = \sum_{k = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} x^k y^{n - k}
$$

Each term in the expansion corresponds to choosing $k$ of the $n$ terms to be $x$, and the rest $y$.

### Example: Expand $(x + y)^3$

$$
\begin{gathered}
(x + y)^3 = \binom{3}{0}x^0y^3 + \binom{3}{1}x^1y^2 + \binom{3}{2}x^2y^1 + \binom{3}{3}x^3y^0  \\[10pt]
= y^3 + 3xy^2 + 3x^2y + x^3
\end{gathered}
$$

### Example: Total Number of Subsets

**How many subsets does a set of $n$ elements have?**

Solution: $\sum_{k = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = 2^n$

**Subsets with at least 1 element:** $2^n - 1$

### Example: Counting Heads

What is the probability of getting **exactly 3 heads** in **5 coin tosses**?

Solution: This is a **binomial experiment**

- Each toss has 2 outcomes: head (H) or tail (T).
- Each outcome is independent.
- Probability of head: p = 0.5, tail: 1‚àíp=0.5.

We use the **binomial probability formula**:

$P(k \text{ heads in } n \text{ tosses}) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$

Here, $n = 5, k = 3, p = 0.5$

Where,

- $p$ = Probability of Success
- $q$ = Probability of Failure $(1-p)$
- $n$ = No. of trials
- $k$ = No. of times for a specific outcome within $n$ trials

$$
P(3 \text{ heads}) = \binom{5}{3} (0.5)^3 (0.5)^2 = \binom{5}{3} (0.5)^5 = 10 \times \frac{1}{32} = \frac{10}{32} = 0.3125
$$

So, there is a **31.25%** chance of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 fair coin tosses.

**Binomial Theorem vs. Binomial Distribution**

- Binomial theorem is a formula for expanding powers of sums algebraically.
- Binomial distribution applies this formula to model probabilities of successes in repeated independent trials.

## Multinomial Theorem

For expanding $(x + y + z)^n$ or $(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_m)^n$, the **multinomial theorem** is used.

It generalizes the binomial theorem to more than two terms. The expansion is:

$$
(x + y + z)^n = \sum_{a+b+c = n} \frac{n!}{a! \, b! \, c!} \, x^a y^b z^c
$$

where $a, b, c \geq 0$ and $a + b + c = n$.

The coefficients $\frac{n!}{a! b! c!}$ are called **multinomial coefficients**.

The general form is:

$$
(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_m)^n = \sum_{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_m = n} \frac{n!}{a_1! a_2! \cdots a_m!} \, x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} \cdots x_m^{a_m}
$$

where each $a_i \geq 0$ and the sum of all $a_i$ equals $n$.
