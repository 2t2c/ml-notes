# Introduction to Vectors

## **What**

A *vector* is a mathematical object that has both **magnitude** (size) and **direction**. It is often represented as an arrow in space or as an ordered list of numbers.

**Example**: In 2D, the vector **v = [3, 4]** represents a movement 3 units along the x-axis and 4 units along the y-axis.

## **How**

Vectors are typically written as coordinate pairs or triplets (like [x, y] or [x, y, z]) depending on the number of dimensions. You can perform operations such as:

- **Addition**: [1, 2] + [3, 4] = [4, 6]
- **Scalar multiplication**: 2 × [3, 4] = [6, 8]
- **Dot product**: [1, 2] • [3, 4] = 1×3 + 2×4 = 11

These operations are useful for combining or comparing vectors.

## **Why**

Vectors are fundamental in fields like physics, computer graphics, and machine learning because they model quantities with direction and magnitude. For instance:

- In physics, a force is a vector.
- In computer graphics, vectors describe movement and lighting.
- In machine learning, data points and weights are represented as vectors for efficient computation.
