# ML-Notes

Welcome to my collection of structured notes on various topics in machine learning, mathematics, and computer science. These notes are compiled from courses, books, YouTube lectures, online forums, and personal study sessions. The goal is to create a structured and accessible resource for learning and revision across topics like mathematics, machine learning, and computer science. 

This is still a work in progress i.e. more content, corrections, and refinements are being added regularly.
